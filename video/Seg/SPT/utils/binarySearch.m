% BINARY SEARCH ALGORITHM
% Description : 
%    mex function that performs the binary search algorithm to find "item(s)"
%    (the values to be searched for) among some pre-sorted "data" vector.
%    By default, the algorithm returns the index of the first instance of each "item"
%    (if there are multiple copies found), and returns the index of the closest item
%    if the item(s) are not found (although these behaviors can be changed 
%    with appropriate optional input parameters.)
%
%  Note : by default, the algorithm does not check whether the input data is sorted (since 
%   that would be an O(N) procedure, which would defeat the purpose of the
%   algorithm.  If the input data is not sorted, the output values will be incorrect.
%
% 
% Matlab call syntax:
%    pos = binarySearchMatlab(data, items, [dirIfFound], [dirIfNotFound], [checkIfSorted_flag])
%
%
% Input: This function requires (pre-sorted) reference data vector "data", 
%  as well as a second input, "items" to search for. "items" can be any size. 
%
% Output : "pos" is the same size as the input "items".
%   
% * Optional input arguments: 'dirIfFound' and 'dirIfNotFound' specify
%   the function's behavior if the items are not found, or if multiple 
%   items are found: (Supply an empty vector [] to leave as the default.)
%   Note, if you like, you can change the default behavior in each case by
%   modifying the DEFAULT values in the #define section below.
%
%   dirIfFound  specifies the function's behavior if *multiple* copies of the 
%      value in "items" are found.
%     -1, or 'first' : [default] the position of the *first* occurence of 'item' is returned
%     +1, or 'last'  : the position of the *last* occurence of 'item' is returned. 
%      0, or 'any'   : the position of the first item that the algorithm discovers is found
%           (ie. not necessarily the first or last occurence)
%
%   dirIfNotFound specifies the behavior if the value in "items" is *not* found.
%        0, or 'exact'   : the value 0 is returned.            
%       -1, or 'down'    : the position of the last item smaller than 'item' is returned.
%       +1, or 'up'      : the position of the first item greater than 'item' is returned.
%        2, or 'closest' : [default], the position of the *closest* item closest to 'item' 
%						    is returned
%        0.5, or 'frac'  : the function returns a *fractional* value, indicating, the 
%							relative position between the two data items between which 'item' 
%							would be located if it was in the data vector. 
%					        (eg if you are searching for the number 5 (and "data" starts off 
%							with [ 2, 3, 4, 7,...], then the algorithm returns 3.333, because 
%							5 is 1/3 of the way between the 3th and the 4th elements of "data".
%
% checkIfSorted_flag
%     By default, this program is set *not* to check that the input data vector is sorted.
%    (although you can change this by setting the defined CHECK_IF_INPUT_SORTED_DEFAULT as 1)
%    However, if you provide a non-empty 5th argument the input data will be checked. 
%    (You might use this, for example, while debugging your  code, and remove it later 
%     to improve performance)
%
%  Example:
%     data = 1:100;
%     items = [pi, 42, -100]
%     binarySearch(data, items)
%     ans =
%          3    42     1
