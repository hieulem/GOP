% function [masks, scores] = cpmc(exp_dir, img_name, diversify_const, ranker_file, segm_pars)
%
% Implementation of the CPMC algorithm. It computes a ranked set of figure-ground segmentation, with associated scores.
% 
% Inputs: 
%   - exp_dir is the folder where the data is (images, ranker models,
%   codebooks, etc.)
%   - img_name is the name of the image without the ending, assuming a jpg file
%   - diversify_const is the the diversification parameter (between 0 and 1).
%       zero will give a random ranking, one will be a very redundant
%       ranking. Default value is 0.75.
%   - ranker_file is the filename of the ranker model (defaults to the
%   version trained on the training set of the VOC2010 segmentation
%   dataset). Please switch to the version trained on trainval for testing 
%   on imgs not in the train/validation sets.
%   - segm_pars is a struct with default value defined below.
%   Check the code for details.
%
% Outputs: 
%   - masks: the figure-ground segmentations in logical matrices, sorted by score
%   - scores: scores for the sorted list of masks
